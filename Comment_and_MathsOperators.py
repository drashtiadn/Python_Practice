## Comments practice:
# Create a single line comment
# This is a single line comment denote by #

# Create a multiple line comment
'''
This is the multiple line comment
It is denote by single triple quotes or
It is denote by double triple quotes
'''

## Basic Mathematical Operators Practice:
# Create a variable called add and assign it the sum of two numbers
add  = 3 + 5

# Create a variable called sub and assign it the difference of two numbers
sub = 10 - 2

# Create a variable called mult and assign it the product of two numbers
mult = 8 * 6

# Create a variable called div and assign it the quotient of two numbers
div = 9 / 3

# Create a variable called power and assign it the value of a number raised to a power
power = 5 ** 3

# Create a variable called mod and assign it the remainder of a quotient
mod = 9 % 4


## Modulo Practice:
# Create a variable called mod1 and assign it the result of 7 % 5
mod1 = 2

# Create a variable called mod2 and assign it the result of 16 % 6
mod2 = 4

# Create a variable called mod3 and assign it the result of 4 % 3
mod3 = 1


## Order of operations practice:
# Create and assign a variable called ordOp1 the result of 7 + 6 + 9 - 4 * ((9 - 2) ** 2) / 7
ordOp1 = -6.0

# Create and assign a variable called ordOp2 the result of (6 % 4 * (7 + (7 + 2) * 3)) ** 2
ordOp2 = 4624
