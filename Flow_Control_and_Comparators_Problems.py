## Flow Control and Comparators:
# Create a variable and assign to it an expression that is true using the greater than comparator
a = 50/10 > 3

# Create a variable and assign to it an expression that is false using the greater than comparator
b = 3*1 > 5

# Create a variable and assign to it an expression that is true using the greater than or equal to comparator
c = 5**2 >= 3*2

# Create a variable and assign to it an expression that is false using the greater than or equal to comparator
d = 3/1 >= 5*2

# Create a variable and assign to it an expression that is true using the less than comparator
e = 3**2 < 5**10

# Create a variable and assign to it an expression that is false using the less than comparator
f = 500/5 < 30

# Create a variable and assign to it an expression that is true using the less than or equal to comparator
g = 30%10 <= 500

# Create a variable and assign to it an expression that is false using the less than or equal to comparator
h = 5**25 <= 3**25

# Create a variable and assign to it an expression that is true using the equal to comparator
i = 3 == 3

# Create a variable and assign to it an expression that is false using the equal to comparator
j = 3 == 5

# Create a variable and assign to it an expression that is true using the not equal to comparator
k = 3 != 5

# Create a variable and assign to it an expression that is false using the not equal to comparator
l = 5 != 5
